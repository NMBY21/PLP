# OOP

## Part 1: Design Your Own Class
- Created a `Smartphone` class with attributes and methods.
- Added `GamingPhone` subclass that inherits from `Smartphone` and introduces a `play_game()` method.

## Part 2: Polymorphism Challenge
- Defined a `Vehicle` base class.
- Implemented subclasses: `Car`, `Plane`, and `Boat`.
- Each subclass overrides the `move()` method with different behavior.

## How to Run
```bash
python main.py
